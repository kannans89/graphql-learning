# Apollo Client

 We have used Apollo Server to build graphql specification on server side.It is quick and easy to build production ready GraphQL server.Now lets look at client side.

Apollo Client is the best way to use GraphQL to build client applications. The client is designed to help developer quickly build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.

Apollo Client supports following platforms.

|Sr No |  Platform |  Framework
|:----:|:----------|:------------------
|  1 | Javascript  | React,Angular,Vue,Meteor,Ember
|  2 | WebComponents  | Polymer , lit-apollo
|  3 | Native Mobile  | Native Android with Java, Native iOS with Swift

One of the major feature of apollo client is caching. Apollo boost is a convenience package which brings in a bunch of other dependencies`npm install apollo-boost graphql`
we can cross verify this by typing `npm view apollo-boost dependencies`
this will have many dependencies to fetch things easily we use apollo-boost

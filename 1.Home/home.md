GraphQL is an open source server side technology . GraphQL was developed by facebook to optimise RESTful API calls. It is a data query language as well as an execution engine.

This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of  GraphQL. In this tutorial we will :

- Implement GraphQL API using Apollo server  
- Test GraphQL API using GraphiQL  
- Build ReactJS(with Apollo Client library) and jQuery client applications to consume the API

GraphQL servers are available for multiple languages, including JavaScript, Java, C#. This course is based on JavaScript  so if you have basic understanding on JavaScript programming then it will be fun to learn GraphQL.
